# Pause/Resume Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The application currently has **NO pause/resume functionality**. The system only supports complete start/stop cycles with the following issues:

1. **No Pause/Resume Architecture**: Only binary recording/stopped states exist
2. **Thread Safety Problems**: Non-atomic state transitions, unprotected shared variables
3. **Error Handling Gaps**: Silent failures in audio writing operations (`let _ = w.write_sample(s)`)
4. **Race Conditions**: Multiple state variables updated non-atomically (e.g., `is_recording_voice` flag)

## Professional Pause/Resume Algorithm Design

### State Machine Architecture
```
States: Idle → Recording → Paused → Recording → Stopped
                ↓
            Stopping (cleanup)
```

### Core Design Principles

**A. Single Source of Truth**
- Centralized state management in `AppState`
- All components query same state source
- State transitions trigger events to UI

**B. Command Pattern**
- All operations (start/pause/resume/stop) are commands
- Commands are queued and processed atomically
- Failed commands can be retried or rolled back

**C. Buffer Management**
- Audio stream continues during pause (no stream interruption)
- Buffering system discards audio during pause
- Resume continues from exact pause point

**D. Error Recovery**
- Transient failures don't break recording session
- Automatic retry mechanisms for I/O operations
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Technical Architecture

**Enhanced State Management**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
enum RecordingState {
    Idle,
    Starting,
    Recording { start_time: Instant },
    Paused { pause_time: Instant, elapsed: Duration },
    Resuming,
    Stopping,
}

enum RecordingCommand {
    Start(RecordingConfig),
    Pause,
    Resume,
    Stop,
}
```

**Thread Architecture**
- **Main Thread**: UI interactions, state management
- **Command Thread**: Processes recording commands atomically
- **Audio Thread**: Continuous audio capture (never paused)
- **Writer Thread**: Handles file I/O with buffering

**Communication Channels**
- Command channel: UI → Command processor
- Event channel: State changes → UI notifications
- Audio channel: Audio capture → Writer (with pause capability)

### Pause/Resume Flow Design

**Pause Operation**
1. Receive pause command
2. Atomically transition to `Paused` state
3. Record pause timestamp
4. Stop writing audio samples (keep capturing)
5. Emit pause event to UI
6. Continue monitoring audio levels for UI meter

**Resume Operation**
1. Receive resume command
2. Validate can resume (must be in Paused state)
3. Atomically transition to `Recording` state
4. Resume writing audio samples
5. Update elapsed time calculation
6. Emit resume event to UI

**Error Handling**
- If pause fails: Log error, stay in current state
- If resume fails: Attempt recovery, fallback to manual restart
- If I/O fails during resume: Buffer audio until I/O recovers

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement new state machine with atomic transitions
- [ ] Add command processing system
- [ ] Create enhanced AppState structure
- [ ] Add proper error handling for state transitions

### Phase 2: Audio Threading Refactor
- [ ] Separate audio capture from audio writing
- [ ] Add buffering system with pause capability
- [ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add proper mutex protection for shared state

### Phase 3: UI Integration
- [ ] Add pause/resume buttons to interface
- [ ] Update state synchronization between UI and backend
- [ ] Add visual feedback for all recording states
- [ ] Update button text based on current state

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for state machine transitions
- [ ] Integration tests for pause/resume cycles
- [ ] Stress tests for rapid state changes
- [ ] Manual testing across different scenarios

## Quality Assurance Requirements

**Reliability**
- 99.9% success rate for pause/resume operations
- No audio data loss during state transitions
- Graceful recovery from transient failures

**Performance**
- State transitions < 100ms
- No audio dropouts during pause/resume
- UI remains responsive during all operations

**User Experience**
- Clear visual feedback for all states
- Predictable behavior across all scenarios
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick pause/resume

## Technical Files to Modify

1. **src-tauri/src/lib.rs**: Core state machine and command processing
2. **src/main.ts**: UI state management and button handling
3. **index.html**: Add pause/resume buttons
4. **src-tauri/tests/**: Add comprehensive test coverage

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backward Compatibility**: New pause/resume features don't break existing functionality
- **State Consistency**: All state transitions are atomic and reversible
- **Data Integrity**: Audio data is never lost during state changes
- **Thread Safety**: All shared state properly protected with mutexes
